		<p class="body">AutoWaves can be run like any windows program.  However before first-time operation it must be run in set-up mode.  This allows the user to generate and export the required text parameters file.  To run the set up utility, the user must double click on the program executable.  In Windows, by default AutoWaves is installed in Program Files. The AutoWaves setup GUI will launch with the following window:</p>

		 <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="body">
		The setup GUI allows users to select AutoWaves processing options and export the required run_parameters text file.  First-time users may want to consult the AutoWaves user’s guide that is available from the Help button on the setup GUI.</p>
		<p class="body">The run_parameters text file provides the required data filenames and processing instructions to AutoWaves.  Included are parameters to specify data preparation (smoothing, sub-sampling), selected analyses, output graphical displays and output data files. There is no required naming convention on this text file and the user may have multiple versions for different applications. See Appendix I for a detailed line-by-line description of the text parameters file contents.  Appendix II includes information on importing data.  Appendix III provides detail on selecting Wave Systems analysis parameters.  Appendix IV provides detail on Spectral Fit parameters.  Appendix V provides detail on Sea State parameters and Appendix VI describes Export Wizard parameters. Furthermore, details on loading specific wind and wave data types are provided below (see Loading Wind and Wave Data).  
		Once a text parameters file has been created, program set up is finished and the command prompt window can be closed by the user by selecting the Exit button.</p>
		<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="green-heading">Launching AutoWaves</p>
		<p class="body">Once set-up has been run, AutoWaves is launched like any other application on your computer.  There are three basic run options.  Each of these is described below.</p>
		<p class="body">Run Option 1 – Clicking Run from the Splash Screen</p>
		<p class="body">The autowaves.exe program can be launched by selecting Run on the Splash Screen.  The most recently selected or exported run_parameters text file will be used to provide data processing options.</p>
		<p class="body">Run Option 2 – Windows Service Mode</p>
		<p class="body">If the Windows Service Mode was selected during program set-up, the built-in Microsoft Windows scheduler is used.  The user must set up the Windows scheduler utility to select program run times and frequency. See the help guides for the particular Windows version that you are using.</p>
		<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="body">Run Option 3 – Called by another program</p>
		<p class="body">The autowaves.exe program can be called by a third-party program running in the background.  If called without any additional inputs, the most recently selected run_parameters text file will be used. The program can also be called with a specific input to the desired run_parameters text file:</p>
		<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="body">autowaves “parameters_file”,</p>
		<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="body">where “parameters file” provides the complete path and filename of the desired parameters file. This mode is useful for applications that will use more than one parameters file.  </p>
		<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="body">Run Option 4 – Command Prompt</p>
		<p class="body">AutoWaves can be directly launched from the command line with, or without the parameter file name as an input argument.  To run in this mode you must open a command prompt.  In Windows this is typically accomplished from the Start menu.  Once you have the command prompt available, set your current directory to the directory where autowaves.exe is located.  To run the program, enter the command:</p>
		<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="body">autowaves “parameters_file”</p>
		<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="body">where  “parameters_file” is the complete path and filename of the desired run_parameters file.</p>
