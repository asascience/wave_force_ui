        <!-- <p class="green-heading">Direction Conventions</p> -->
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">In general XWaves stores all wind and wave directions in the standard meteorological “Degrees from North” convention, where angles rotate clockwise from north (0 Deg).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">All plots display directions with this convention with the exception of vector plots, such as the Wave Systems Vector Plot in the <a href="wave_systems_module.html#collapse0">Wave Systems Module</a>. The vector plots rotate wind and wave directions 180 degrees to display them in vector form as “Degrees towards”, again with rotation clockwise from north.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">The only exception to this direction convention rule is with the BlueFat table export function, which provides the option to rotate all directions relative to ship azimuth (180 = head on seas). For this feature a ship heading file must be provided by the user.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Magnetic Compass Corrections</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">As many conventional wave sensors collect wave direction data using a magnetic compass, correction is necessary in order to rotate the wave directions relative to True North. Most of the XWaves data formatters allow the user to input a Magnetic Compass Correction factor to facilitate this correction. This parameter is the magnetic declination, sometimes called magnetic variation, which is the angle between magnetic north and true north. The Magnetic Compass Correction should be entered as positive east of true north and negative when west. The input wave directions will be rotated by this angle to generate directions relative to True North.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">The magnetic compass correction is a function of latitude and longitude and can be computed on a web page hosted by the National Geophysical Data Center: <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination">http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#declination</a>.</p>
