        <p class="body"> Wave spectral partitioning provides an efficient approach to characterize energy levels of individual wind-sea and swell wave components in directional wave spectra. Here a ‘wave component’ is defined as a specific wind-sea or swell that can be attributed to a region of enhanced energy in the directional wave spectrum. The time evolution of a series of related wave components forms a ‘wave system’ that can be traced to a specific generation region on the ocean surface. Wave spectral partitioning methods have been applied in a variety of investigations, including the comparison of wave fields from the Labrador Sea Extreme Waves Experiment (Beal 1989), the validation of WAve Model WAM performance against ERS-1 SAR spectra (Hasselmann et al. 1994), the assimilation of wave observations into the WAM model (Voorrips et al. 1997), the analysis of wind sea growth and dissipation in the open ocean (Hanson and Phillips 1999), a study of swell evolution across the Pacific (Hanson and Phillips 2001), and an analysis of nearshore wave climatology (Scott et al. 2002). </p>

        <p class="body"> Originally proposed by Gerling (1992), wave partitioning allows the identification and grouping of component wave systems from spatially and temporally distributed observations of directional wave spectra. A primary limitation to the Gerling approach is that only those portions of the spectrum that rise above a constant threshold are used to determine the features of particular wave component. Hasselmann et al. (1994) improved on this method by dividing the spectrum into subset domains based on an inverted catchment area approach, thus using the entire spectral region of each peak to compute wave component parameters. Hanson (1996) and Hanson and Phillips (2001) made further improvements to the technique by adding clustering routines to track the evolution of individual wave components and dispersion calculations to estimate the source time and location of resulting wave systems. Work has continued on the development of these techniques since the publication of Hanson and Phillips (2001), hereinafter referred to as HP01, to the point that we now have a fully automated, GUI-driven system employing modern image processing technology for performing a wide range of wave system analyses on time-evolving series of directional wave spectra. </p>
        <p id='u2262-5'>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body"> For completeness, we summarize the methods here and provide detail on the improvements that have been made since HP01. </p>

        <p class="blue-heading">Wave Component Identification</p>
        <p class="body">The first step of spectral partitioning is to isolate spectral regions S(f,&theta;) associated with individual energy peaks. This was accomplished by HP01 with a time-consuming recursive algorithm that assigned each spectrum value to a path of steepest ascent associated with a local peak. All paths leading to the same peak were assigned to a distinct spectral partition. This step has been improved with efficient image processing routines that were designed for making watershed delineations in topographic imagery (Soille 1999, Vincent and Soille 1991). Treating the spectrum as an inverse topographic domain, an 8-point connected smoothing transform removes fine-scale noise in the spectrum. A watershed delineation transform then identifies the boundaries forming the minima between remaining spectral peaks. Spectral regions surrounded by such boundaries become individual partitions. This change in basic methodology has reduced by an order of magnitude the time required to process each record, with essentially no change in output results.</p>

            <p class="body">The resulting wave components are sorted into wind-sea or swell. To be classified as wind-sea, a spectral peak must be forced by a component of the existing wind. A wave-age criterion is used to identify and combine the 2D wind-sea partitions. All remaining peaks are labeled as swell. Adjacent 2D swell peaks that are contiguous in frequency can be part of the same swell system and are combined under certain conditions. Two tests are made to determine if adjacent swell peaks belong to the same wave system. A swell angle threshold test requires the mean directions of adjacent peaks be separated by less than a threshold angle. A threshold value of 30 deg yielded optimum results with the Pacific Ocean data and provided a comfortable margin outside the stated +/-10-deg accuracy of the buoy directions. A second test compares the f, &theta; spectral distance between peaks in relation to their individual spectral spreads. Peaks are combined if the spread of either peak is large compared to the distance between the two peaks. Wave component statistics are updated after each combination is made.</p>

            <p class="blue-heading">Swell Tracking</p>
            <p class="body">Once a time series of directional wave spectra has been partitioned, a clustering algorithm is used to link common wave components together through time. This results in the generation of wave systems, which are statistically represented by time-evolving series of Hs (approximated by H<SUB>mo</SUB>), T<SUB>p</SUB>, and attributes associated with each wave component. A convenient display of these features is in the form of the wave vector history plot shown in Fig 2a. At any given time, the wave field is composed of multiple wave components that are members of a distinct evolving wave system. For example, the wave vectors at the dashed vertical line in Fig 2a correspond to the wave components identified in Fig. 1. The wave vector history shows how these particular components evolve through time. Wind-seas (black arrows) are driven by local winds. The swell events are more persistent, with systems from the North and South Pacific both typically lasting about 6 days. It is interesting to note that the two most energetic wave height events during this two-week period (Fig. 2b) are a result of the superposition of locally increased wind-seas with energetic swells from three different origins.</p>
