            </span>A NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) interface is included with the XWaves ocean wave field analysis toolbox. The NetCDF libraries are a freely-distributed set of read and write utilities for array-oriented data that include utilities for C, FORTRAN, C++, Java, MATLAB and other languages. XWaves uses the native MATLAB NetCDF functions along with the MEXNC and SNCTOOLS function sets to interface with NetCDF files.&nbsp; Information on these can be found at:
            <br /><a class="nonblock" href="http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/.">http://mexcdf.sourceforge.net/.&nbsp; </a> The use of a NetCDF interface in XWaves essentially removes the file size limitations on both data processing and the creation of graphical displays. Furthermore this capability has been developed to work in the 64-bit architecture. This interface significantly increases the utility of XWaves for applications involving very large data sets</p>

        <p class="body">XWaves operates on the data structure wavedat that is stored as a MATLAB *.mat binary file.&nbsp; This data structure includes the following elements:</p>
        <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u4344-43">
            <li class="body">Supporting metadata</li>
            <li class="body">Observed or modeled wave spectra data and related statistics</li>

            <li class="body">Processed results</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="caption" id="u4344-46">Expansion of XWaves configuration with a NetCDF data interface.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">As the left side of the Figure below depicts, all of the <span id="u4344-50">XWaves</span> modules are designed to operate on the <span id="u4344-52">wavedat</span> data structure.&nbsp; As data are processed, results are automatically added to wavedat.&nbsp; The user has the option of saving these updates in the original *.mat-file or creating a new *.mat-file on disk.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">The integration of NetCDF file formats within <span id="u4344-57">XWaves</span> introduces a new functional component called the Data Parser.&nbsp; As depicted in the Figure, the Parser maintains a 2-way flow of data between the XWaves modules and the NetCDF data file.&nbsp; Essentially the Parser extracts NetCDF data as needed and writes NetCDF data as produced by <span id="u4344-59">XWaves</span>.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">The primary functions of the Parser are to:</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <ul class="list0 nls-None" id="u4344-80">
            <li class="body">Establish a linkage between the NetCDF data fields and the <span id="u4344-67">wavedat</span> fields</li>
            <li class="body">Communicate with individual modules on data needs</li>
            <li class="body">Populate resident <span id="u4344-73">wavedat</span> structure with data as required</li>
            <li class="body">Write results to the NetCDF data file as produced</li>
            <li class="body">Operate on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows machines</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">Hence <span id="u4344-83">XWaves</span> has two slightly distinct modes of operation; (1) the original wavedat mode where all the information needed for processing and all of the processing results are stored in memory, and (2) the NetCDF mode where information is loaded as needed into memory from a NetCDF file and moved back out of memory (and into the NetCDF file) as new information is produced.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">All of the internal <span id="u4344-88">XWaves</span> functions continue to obtain all required data and information from the resident wavedat data structure.&nbsp; The Parser moves data in and out of this structure as it is needed and produced.</p>

        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Required NetCDF Tools</p>
        <p class="body">The latest versions of MEXNC and SNCTOOLS are used for the XWaves NetCDF interface.&nbsp; MEXNC is a mex-file interface to NetCDF files for MATLAB.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is compiled with NetCDF library versions 3.6.0 or higher, which includes the benefit of Large File Support.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of MEXNC are employed.&nbsp; SNCTOOLS is a set of m-files that sit on top of MEXNC.&nbsp; XWaves will use SNCTOOLS to operate the MEXNC interface.&nbsp; Information on these can be found at:
