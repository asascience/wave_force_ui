PROGRAM OPERATION
Data import, processing, generation of output products are automatic when AutoWaves is launched.  If waitbars are set to ‘on’ in the parameters file, they will be displayed to inform the user of program progress.  When processing is complete, output products are automatically written to the filename and location specified in the parameters file.
For troubleshooting you can launch AutoWaves from a command prompt (Run Option 4).  Any generated error messages will be written to the command prompt window.

LOADING WIND AND WAVE DATA
AutoWaves provides a complete sea state analysis of observed or modeled sea conditions.  Wave data are obtained from directional wave sensors such as a buoy, radar or acoustic measurement device; from numerical wave models such as WaveWatch III or SWAN, or from climatological data bases such as from Oceanweather.  Furthermore, the delineation of sea and swell is optimized if wind speed and direction data are also provided as inputs.  A summary of the available input formats are described below.

Wave Data Formats

There are many different technologies for measuring and modeling waves and unfortunately no widely adopted standards for the storage and reporting of directional wave data.  Hence AutoWaves has been adapted to read in directional wave data from a diverse set of input formats.  A summary listing of these input formats is provided in Table 1.

Sample files for each of these input data formats are available upon request from WaveForce Technologies.  Please note that NetCDF dataypes are not yet supported by stand-alone versions of AutoWaves.  

Wind Data Formats

For those wave data formats that do not include wind data (See Table 1), an optional wind data file can be loaded.  The use of wind data is not required; however the performance of the wave partitioning algorithm can be improved when winds are provided.  At present the wind data are provided in a binary Matlab (*.mat) file.  The mat-file contains an 8-column matrix named wind with the following columns:

1.	Year (YYYY)
2.	Month (MM)
3.	Day (DD)
4.	Hour (hh)
5.	Minute (mm)
6.	Second (ss)
7.	Wind Direction (deg true from N)
8.	10-m Wind speed (m/s)
The wind observation times are not required to match up with the wave observation times, as AutoWaves will vector interpolate the wind data to the wave data observation times.  Example wind files are available from WaveForce Technologies.

AUTOMATIC AND WINDOWS SERVICE UPDATE MODES
For real-time operations with WavescanTS data formats, AutoWaves allows the selection of either Automatic or Windows Service update modes.  Note that only one of these modes should be selected in the run_parameters.txt file.
If the Automatic Update Mode is selected, AutoWaves will launch automatically on a user-defined time interval (h).  The computer clock is used to log the time interval.  
If the Windows Service Mode is selected, The Windows Scheduler should be set up to launch the AutoWaves application at desired intervals.  
In both of these update modes, AutoWaves will save data files in monthly batches.  The previous feature of generating monthly folders has been disabled.
