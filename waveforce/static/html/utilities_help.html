        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-2">Utilities Module</span> provides a variety of database manipulation tools for user wave data.&nbsp; These utility functions allow the user to add or remove data records, apply cross-record smoothing or sub-sampling, and change the angular resolution of wave spectrum records.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="blue-heading">Launching the Utilities Module</p>
        <p class="body">Once data has been loaded (see <a href="../xwaves/loading_data.html#collapse0">Loading Data</a>), the Utility Module can be launched by selecting the Data Utilities command in the Module pull-down menu.&nbsp; Since the data utilities will make changes to the data in memory, a Save Data window appears and provides the opportunity to save user data before proceeding. If the user has already run <a href="../xwaves/wave_systems_module.html#collapse0">Wave Systems</a> on this data, the Save Data window will warn the user that wave system information will be lost. This is because the data utilities only operate on the wave spectrum records, not processed wave system data.&nbsp; However if only using the Rename utility then no data will be lost.&nbsp; When finished with the Data Utilities, the user can re-run <a href="../xwaves/wave_systems_module.html#collapse0">Wave Systems</a> on the data to generate new wave system information.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">When the <span id="u2883-18">Utilities Module</span> is launched an interactive <span id="u2883-20">Data Utilities</span> window appears. Record listing boxes show the years, months, days, and records represented in the user data. All utility functions are activated from this window.&nbsp; A list of the available commands, and instructions for their operation, appear below.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="blue-heading">Utility Commands</p>
        <p class="subheading">Smooth Records</p>
        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-29">Smooth Records</span> utility performs a weighted running average over the wave spectra. This utility is activated by clicking on the <span id="u2883-31">Smooth Records</span> button in the <span id="u2883-33">Data Utilities Window</span>.&nbsp; A message box will request the user to type in the desired wave spectrum smoothing interval in hours.&nbsp; Over this specified duration, the <span id="u2883-35">Utilities Module</span> will perform a weighted running average of the input directional wave spectra.&nbsp; For example, a 4-h smoothing window will smooth all spectra occurring up to 2-h prior and 2-h after each observation time.&nbsp; This feature is helpful for noisy spectra, usually obtained from short time series records, and will help reduce <a href="../xwaves/wave_systems_module.html#collapse0">Wave Systems</a> processing time by eliminating spurious peaks.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">SubSample File</p>
        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-44">SubSample</span> utility reduces user data file sizes by saving only those records that occur at a specified time interval. This utility is activated by clicking on the SubSample File button in the <span id="u2883-46">Data Utilities Window</span>.&nbsp; A message box will request the user to type in the desired interval in hours for record sub-sampling.&nbsp; The <span id="u2883-48">Utility Module</span> will remove records that fall in-between this interval.&nbsp; For example, if a 3-h data subsample interval is selected for data that is provided hourly, every third record will be saved.&nbsp; This feature is helpful for decreasing the size of large files, and will reduce <a href="../xwaves/wave_systems_module.html#collapse0">Wave Systems</a> processing time by providing fewer records to process.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Spectral Resolution</p>
        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-57">Spectral Resolution</span> utility is used to change the frequency range, frequency resolution, and directional resolution of the directional wave spectra.&nbsp; This utility is activated by clicking on the <span id="u2883-59">Spectral Resolution</span> button in the <span id="u2883-61">Data Utilities Window</span>.&nbsp; A Spectral Resolution GUI will open that allows the user to specify the frequency and angle bins in the output directional spectra.&nbsp; Input spectra are linearly interpolated to the requested resolution.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="body">The use of this feature can greatly reduce output file sizes and save on <a href="../xwaves/wave_systems_module.html#collapse0">Wave Systems</a> processing times for large data sets.&nbsp; Measured data are often set at a directional resolution that is much greater than the instrument can actually resolve.&nbsp; Try setting your angular resolution at 10 or 15 degrees, corresponding to 36 or 24 angle bins.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Append File</p>
        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-73">Append File</span> utility is used to add another data set to the current loaded data.&nbsp; This utility is activated by clicking on the <span id="u2883-75">Append File</span> button in the <span id="u2883-77">Data Utilities Window</span>.&nbsp; A browser window will open to allow the user to select a data file to append.&nbsp; Selected files must have observation times that either precede or follow the observation times of the user data in memory.&nbsp; Once a file to append is selected, click on <span id="u2883-79">Open</span> to execute the utility.&nbsp; Once the utility is complete, the window display of available data records is updated.</p>
        <p class="subheading">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Subset File</p>
        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-86">Subset File</span> utility allows the user to create a new data file from a subset of the user data in memory.&nbsp; The user should first interactively select the range of data to be subset.&nbsp; Data can be selected by year, month, day, or record attributes by clicking and dragging the cursor over the desired range, shift-clicking a range, or double-clicking on a particular attribute.&nbsp; Control-clicks can be used to select different data segments to subset.&nbsp; Once the desired range is selected, clicking on the <span id="u2883-88">Subset File</span> button activates the utility.&nbsp; Once the utility is complete, the window display of available data records is updated.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Remove Records</p>
        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-95">Remove Records</span> utility allows the user to extract and discard records from the user data in memory.&nbsp; The user should first interactively select the range of data to be removed.&nbsp; Data can be selected by year, month, day, or record attributes by clicking and dragging the cursor over the desired range, shift-clicking a range, or double-clicking on a particular attribute.&nbsp; Control-clicks can be used to select different data segments to subset.&nbsp; Once the desired range is selected, clicking on the <span id="u2883-97">Remove Records </span>button activates the utility.&nbsp; Once the utility is complete, the window display of available data records is updated.</p>
        <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="subheading">Rename</p>
        <p class="body">The <span id="u2883-104">Rename</span> utility allows the user to change the name of the user data in memory.&nbsp; Clicking on Rename opens up an input dialog box with the current name.&nbsp; The user can either change the name and click <span id="u2883-106">OK</span> to save or click <span id="u2883-108">Cancel</span> to keep the existing name.&nbsp; Selecting rename will not cause any processed data to be lost.</p>
