        </span>The Wave Systems Editor allows the user to make manual adjustments to the Wave Systems in a given record. The wave systems are generated automatically from the Wave Systems module based on the parameters set in the Wave Systems Parameter Table. The user can combine or separate wave systems as desired but the following restrictions apply:</p>
    <p class="body">1. The wind sea system cannot be combined or
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separated.</p>
    <p class="body">2. Wave Systems that overlap in time cannot be
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combined.</p>
    <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="blue-heading">Launching the Wave Systems Editor</p>
    <p class="body">Data must first be loaded (see Start Up) and processed using Wave Systems.&nbsp; The Wave Systems Editor can be launched by selecting the Wave Systems Utilities; an extension of Data Utilities found in the Module pull-down menu.&nbsp; Because the Wave Systems Editor will make changes to the data in memory, a Save Data window appears and provides the opportunity to save user data before proceeding.</p>
    <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="body">Once launched, a Wave Systems Significant Wave Height plot and a text box with all the available wave systems will appear in the interactive Wave Systems Utilities window. From this window, the user can select which Wave Systems to combine or separate. Each wave system is labeled and color coded for convenience.</p>
    <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="blue-heading">Commands</p>
    <p class="subheading">Separate</p>
    <p class="body">To separate a wave system, select the desired wave system from the text box and click the Separate button. A new window will appear with a list of all the records containing this wave system. Select one of the records in the list to determine when to separate the wave system.</p>
    <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="subheading">Combine</p>
    <p class="body">To combine a wave system, select any two wave systems from the text box and press the Combine button. Select more than one system by holding the Ctrl button while clicking. Only two wave systems can be combined at a time. Wave systems that overlap in time cannot be combined. If the gap between selected wave systems is greater than 6 hours, a warning will appear and ask the user if they would like to continue.</p>
    <p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="subheading">Convert to Wind Sea</p>
    <p class="body">The user also has the capability to select an existing swell system and convert it to wind sea. Select the desired wave system to convert and press the Convert button.</p>
